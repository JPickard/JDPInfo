				<h1>Technically Savvy &amp; Constantly Learning</h1>
				
				<p>
					Hello.  My name is Joshua David Pickard.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ever since I can remember, I have been interested in electronics with a specific knack for computers.  My parents noticed this and bought me a Commodore 64 when I was ten.  That year, I learned BASIC and wrote a choose-your-own-adventure style game of my own design.  This pattern has followed me through my life.  As computer technology advances, I try to learn as much as possible about it so that I can express myself creatively through it.  So far, the only projects that I can publicly exhibit are what I have created during the Code Louisville instructional sessions (such as this page) or are video game related.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of my professional life has been within the field of Information Technology.  The job duties have included desktop phone support, online chat support, PC installation / upgrades, hardware break / fix bench repair (computers, printers, scanners, CRT controller boards, restaurant "bump bars", and receipt printers), cable TV / internet / digital phone installation and collections, CAT5 networking installation and configuration, and (currently) website support with troubleshooting and database maintenance.  Along the way, I have also developed strong skills using the Microsoft Office Suite of applications.  I am most proud of my MS: Access abilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The skills I have picked up over the years include learning a wide variety of programming and scripting languages such as BASIC, Java, JavaScript, C#, ASP, SQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS.  While I do not profess to possess expert level knowledge in any of these languages, I am very comfortable programming with them and am very confident and capable of researching online to find and implement existing solutions to any issue that arises.  Likewise, I am always eager to learn new programming languages that may be useful to my profession and hobbies.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this time in my life, I am looking for a career that challenges my problem solving skills for creative solutions.  While I am capable of fixing and repairing both hardware and software, I find that I am most satisfied with my efforts when I am making something new.

					<h2>When I Grow Up...</h2>
					
					<p>
						I was born in the 70's.  Computers were big news then, but still were not common in the households of my early years.  The closest I ever got to them as a small child was when I saw an arcade machine at a restaurant.  They facinated me.   I wanted to play them, but even more, I wanted to make them.  I finally met up with a like minded computer enthusiest in the 4th grade where the classrooms finally got some Apple II computers for the students to try out.  That guy became my best friend and we both swore that day that we would become computer programmers.  He is now employed at a place in Ohio doing just that...  programming for his employer's clients.  The last time I heard from him (last month), he was happy.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am working at a place where I help maintain a website with an old code base written in ASP with a C# code-behind supported with a SQL Server database.  Learning to program is actively encouraged there, and I am learning a lot.  I am grateful to my current employer for all the opportunities I have been given.  And while where I work is a positive and healthy work environment, it is a small business and there is little opportunity to advance my earning potential.
					</p>
					<p>
						By my understanding, HTML5, SASS, Logulo, and other new languages and technologies are the trend of the future.  Even though I am middle-aged, I have a lot of life and potential to ahead of me.  I would like to place myself in the best environment to best learn the technologies that are at the forefront of the industry.  Then, I can maximize my personal worth and potential to find <strong>complete</strong> satisfaction in my career.
					</p>

					<h2>Learning New Skills</h2>
					
					<p>
						Code Louisville was suggested to me by my best friend's wife who knew I was looking to expand my programming career options.  While I was initially surprised that the first lessons were to be about HTML and CSS, I stuck out the first few lessons through the parts I already knew to get to the parts I needed to know.  I am glad I did.  When the lessons finally got around to the more advanced topics of JavaScript and PHP, I really engaged.  In fact, the tabs and blocks of this section were written by me using my newly developed JavaScript skills!  It is very exciting to learn new things and see them in use.
					</p>
					<p>
						All in all, my HTML skills are now updated and enhanced.  My understanding of CSS is much broader.  I am still learning how to use common tools of the trade like GitHub and Laravel.  Most of all, Code Louisville has turned me on to the Treehouse online learning program for technical skills.  The video tutorials, while a bit cheesy, are very informative.  Coupled with the practice portions of their learning tracks, I have proven through the earning of badges that I am capable of applying the skills they are teaching.  So far, I have earned 9,416 points in assorted categories including HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, and Design.  I have every intention to learn as much as I can from wherever I can.

					<h2>Challenging Myself to Grow</h2>
					
					<p>
						Ever since Microsoft Office came out with their first suite, I have worked hard to be proficent in its use.  From the mid-90's onward, I have had to use those applications in most of the jobs I've held.  For certain employers, my natural affinity for technology led me to create wonderous databases, reports, and presentations.  In the late 90's, I even learned some of the Microsoft OLE scripting language to write automated actions to occur between the various applications.  Today, they are called macros.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most recently, I developed an Access database for a small electical generator company in West Virginia at the behest of my current employer.  Included in its functionality was inventory management, employee timekeeping, purchase order generation, receipt generation, and various managerial reports as requested by the customer.  The development took about three months with tweaks and ongoing support lasting about 6 more months until all the major issues were finally ironed out.
					</p>
					<p>
						The point to all this is that I never once said "It can't be done".  I always figured out how to implement the customer's desires or discovered an alternate feature to implement that better fulfilled the customer's indirect intention for the request.  In doing so, I pushed into new territory for me and gained knowledge, skill, and experience.

					<h2>What I Do in My Spare Time</h2>
					
					<p>
						Peter Molyneux, Sid Meier, John Carmack, Ron Gilbert, Chris Crawford, Hideo Kojima, and Kevin Flynn.  These are some of my heroes.  They are held in high esteem as great minds who have shaped the course of Video Game history.  Let me add Peter Jackson and Gary Gygax to the list of heroes, though not of video games, but of being at the pinncle of great game design in general. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I like making games.  As mentioned before, I made my first text adventure video game at age 10.  Before that, I had a <cite>Dungeons and Dragons</cite> box set from which I made grand adventures with copious notes and maps drawn out on graph paper.  In college, I was the Game Master for my group of friends for most of whatever we were playing at the time.  I ran the games fairly, kept them exciting, but most of all... everyone had fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						As far as PC gaming goes, I quickly got involved with the mod community starting with <cite>DOOM</cite> and <cite>Duke Nukem 3D</cite>.  Moving on several years, I dabbled with the Unreal Engine and made a map strongly based on the call center where I was employed at the time.  In that same chapter of my life, I made a mod for <cite>Neverwinter Nights</cite> based off a short D&amp;D module.  But my greatest effort and achievement in regards to modding is in realation to the PC game <cite>TRON 2.0</cite>.  Seeing that Disney had dropped support for the game shortly after its release, I, with the help of other TRON afficionados, developed a single-player expansion to that story called <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/user-error" target ="_blank"><cite>USER ERROR</cite></a>.  In that community, I go by the handle "Meatsack".  Learning the Jupiter development tool used to make <cite>TRON 2.0</cite>, I created the entire first 5 levels on my own.  Having written out the plotline for an additional 10 levels, I then handed over all that I had done to the rest of the community to see what they could do with it.  You see, my life had just started an upheaval at the time and my hobbyist hours were no longer available.  To my delight, the community completed <cite>USER ERROR</cite> and released it.  My contributions were labeled as Part 1 and the rest as Part 2.  To my continuing delight, Part 3 is still in the works although I have very little to do with it at this point.  Life moved on.
					</p>
					<P>
						Most recently, I have made new efforts to get in with the "indie" community.  To that end, I have collaborated on a demo of a game called <cite>Super Gunball</cite>.  The intent of the demo is not to lead to a sale, but to showcase my abilities as a game designer and project leader.  Utilizing the <cite>GameMaker Studio: Pro</cite> engine, I built the game as its programmer using the GML scripting language.  Then I recruited a composer and an artist who were willing to work for mention in the credits since it was billed as a hobbyist project.  We were all happy with how the demo turned out and are including it in our portfolios.  The demo in its latest state is completely playable and can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/super-gunball-demo/downloads" target="_blank">IndieDB</a>.
